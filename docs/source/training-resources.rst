Training Resources
==================
In addition to this documentation, we have created training materials that can be used to introduce Field Book to breeders and technicians. These materials are also useful for bringing existing users up-to-speed with new features. This `training presentation <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Milb9mO_LNtLmgo4AQYH7nQ-9E428gGv/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109819954855460677835&rtpof=true&sd=true>`_ introduces Field Book's core features and key settings with accompanying excercises. 

The exercises in the the training slides are based on the `training_sample.csv` field file which is copied into the field_import directory on install and is imported as part training.
