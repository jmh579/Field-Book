|disease| Disease Trait
=======================
Overview
--------

The disease trait format is used for collecting ratings of both disease incidence and severity. It is created with a trait name and optional details. The incidence scale can be adjusted by editing the ``disease_severity.txt`` file in the ``traits`` directory. 

On the collect screen, buttons showing numbers between 0-100 in 5 digit increments are used to record incidence, and **R**, **M**, and **S** are used to record severity. For each measurement, only a single incidence can be recorded while severity types can be combined. The **/** button allows varying incidence rates to be recorded (e.g., heterogenous response within a plot).
